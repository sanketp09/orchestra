# 1. Commodity Intelligence — 2 files

## FILE 1 — component.tsx
CONTEXT: IDE agent with full repo access — Sentinel, Trustline, Compass, Arbiter, and 
Precedent are already built. DO NOT redefine the design system — reuse the existing color 
tokens, shadow tokens, animation primitives (`lib/animations.ts`), and card/grid patterns 
already established in the repo, especially Trustline's bento-grid + soft-depth treatment, 
which Atlas should visually match (Atlas is data-rich like Trustline, not flow-based like 
Sentinel).

CENTRALIZED DEMO DATA — reuse existing entities (Meridian Steel Fabrication / 
vendor_meridian_steel, Austin Semiconductor Fab / project_austin_fab) and add these Atlas-
specific ones, consistent across all ten files below:
- Active shipment: "Switchgear Shipment #4471" — Meridian Steel is the vendor, shipping 
  from a fabrication facility in Ulsan, South Korea, currently mid-transit toward the Port 
  of Houston, destined for project_austin_fab.
- Budget lines for project_austin_fab: structural steel ($2.1M budgeted), copper wiring 
  ($480K budgeted).

SHARED SHAPE — every Atlas signal extends this:
```python
class WorldSignal(BaseModel):
    signal_type: str            # e.g. "commodity_price", "port_congestion", "tariff_change"
    affected_entity_ids: list[str]   # which of YOUR vendors/shipments/projects this touches
    severity: Literal["info","watch","action_needed"]
    summary: str
    detail: dict                 # signal-specific structured data
    recommended_action: str | None
    detected_at: datetime
```
The point of every Atlas screen: don't just show world data, show **which of the user's 
actual active vendors/shipments/budget lines it touches** — every screen must visibly 
connect a world event to something specific and named from the centralized demo data above, 
never a generic "here's some market data" view with no connection back to the user's real 
exposure.

One single .tsx file and one single .py file per feature. Framer-motion animations 
mandatory, matching established repo patterns — staggered mounts, count-up numbers, real 
hover states, no static unanimated screens.

**Grid layout (3 cards):**
- **Hero card (col-span-2, glass treatment):** a live-feeling price chart for structural 
  steel futures over the last 30 days, drawn in (stroke-dashoffset), with a horizontal 
  reference line marking the price level at which the $2.1M structural steel budget for 
  project_austin_fab would be exceeded — the chart should make it visually obvious how 
  close the current price is to that line, not just show a generic price chart.
- **Lock Recommendation card:** a clear recommendation state — "Lock price now" or "Hold — 
  price trending favorably" — as a large badge with a one-line reason, plus an estimated 
  dollar consequence of waiting ("A 6% further rise would cost an additional $126,000").
- **Copper card (smaller):** a compact secondary version of the same pattern for the $480K 
  copper wiring budget line, showing this system tracks multiple commodities per project, 
  not just one.

`GET /atlas/commodity-intelligence?project_id=`. Real external data where feasible: attempt 
a call to a free commodity price data source if one is available in your environment; 
otherwise implement a clearly-commented seeded price history generator that produces a 
plausible 30-day trend (do not claim this is live if it's seeded — comment honestly). 
Deterministic comparison against the seeded project budget lines: compute 
`distance_to_budget_threshold` and a lock/hold recommendation from a simple rule (e.g. 
recommend lock if price is within 10% of the threshold and trending up over the last 5 
days). No LLM needed for this logic.
