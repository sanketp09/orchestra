# 10. Market Signal Aggregation — 2 files

## FILE 1 — component.tsx
CONTEXT: IDE agent with full repo access — Sentinel, Trustline, Compass, Arbiter, and 
Precedent are already built. DO NOT redefine the design system — reuse the existing color 
tokens, shadow tokens, animation primitives (`lib/animations.ts`), and card/grid patterns 
already established in the repo, especially Trustline's bento-grid + soft-depth treatment, 
which Atlas should visually match (Atlas is data-rich like Trustline, not flow-based like 
Sentinel).

CENTRALIZED DEMO DATA — reuse existing entities (Meridian Steel Fabrication / 
vendor_meridian_steel, Austin Semiconductor Fab / project_austin_fab) and add these Atlas-
specific ones, consistent across all ten files below:
- Active shipment: "Switchgear Shipment #4471" — Meridian Steel is the vendor, shipping 
  from a fabrication facility in Ulsan, South Korea, currently mid-transit toward the Port 
  of Houston, destined for project_austin_fab.
- Budget lines for project_austin_fab: structural steel ($2.1M budgeted), copper wiring 
  ($480K budgeted).

SHARED SHAPE — every Atlas signal extends this:
```python
class WorldSignal(BaseModel):
    signal_type: str            # e.g. "commodity_price", "port_congestion", "tariff_change"
    affected_entity_ids: list[str]   # which of YOUR vendors/shipments/projects this touches
    severity: Literal["info","watch","action_needed"]
    summary: str
    detail: dict                 # signal-specific structured data
    recommended_action: str | None
    detected_at: datetime
```
The point of every Atlas screen: don't just show world data, show **which of the user's 
actual active vendors/shipments/budget lines it touches** — every screen must visibly 
connect a world event to something specific and named from the centralized demo data above, 
never a generic "here's some market data" view with no connection back to the user's real 
exposure.

One single .tsx file and one single .py file per feature. Framer-motion animations 
mandatory, matching established repo patterns — staggered mounts, count-up numbers, real 
hover states, no static unanimated screens.

This is Atlas's aggregation/landing view — the "morning briefing" equivalent for external 
risk, pulling a headline from each of the other nine Atlas features into one screen. Build 
this LAST, after the other nine exist, since it reads from all of them.

**Layout:** a bento grid where each of the other 9 features contributes exactly one compact 
summary tile (not the full detail view — a condensed version: icon, one-line headline, 
severity badge, "View details →" link routing to that feature's full screen). Size tiles by 
severity — an "action_needed" signal gets a larger tile (col-span-2) than a calm "info" 
signal (col-span-1) — so the grid's visual weight itself communicates what actually needs 
attention today, not a uniform grid of equally-sized boxes.

Tiles animate in sorted by severity (most urgent first, staggered), and the whole screen 
should feel like the one place a project executive checks each morning instead of visiting 
nine separate screens.

`GET /atlas/daily-briefing?project_id=`. This is purely an aggregation endpoint — it calls 
(or directly queries the same underlying data as) each of the other 9 Atlas endpoints 
already built, extracts one condensed `WorldSignal` summary from each, and returns them 
sorted by severity. Do not duplicate any of the other 9 features' actual logic here — 
import and call their existing functions/models rather than reimplementing commodity 
tracking, weather checks, etc. a second time in this file.
