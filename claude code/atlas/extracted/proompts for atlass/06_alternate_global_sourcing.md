# 6. Alternate Global Sourcing Discovery — 2 files

## FILE 1 — component.tsx
CONTEXT: IDE agent with full repo access — Sentinel, Trustline, Compass, Arbiter, and 
Precedent are already built. DO NOT redefine the design system — reuse the existing color 
tokens, shadow tokens, animation primitives (`lib/animations.ts`), and card/grid patterns 
already established in the repo, especially Trustline's bento-grid + soft-depth treatment, 
which Atlas should visually match (Atlas is data-rich like Trustline, not flow-based like 
Sentinel).

CENTRALIZED DEMO DATA — reuse existing entities (Meridian Steel Fabrication / 
vendor_meridian_steel, Austin Semiconductor Fab / project_austin_fab) and add these Atlas-
specific ones, consistent across all ten files below:
- Active shipment: "Switchgear Shipment #4471" — Meridian Steel is the vendor, shipping 
  from a fabrication facility in Ulsan, South Korea, currently mid-transit toward the Port 
  of Houston, destined for project_austin_fab.
- Budget lines for project_austin_fab: structural steel ($2.1M budgeted), copper wiring 
  ($480K budgeted).

SHARED SHAPE — every Atlas signal extends this:
```python
class WorldSignal(BaseModel):
    signal_type: str            # e.g. "commodity_price", "port_congestion", "tariff_change"
    affected_entity_ids: list[str]   # which of YOUR vendors/shipments/projects this touches
    severity: Literal["info","watch","action_needed"]
    summary: str
    detail: dict                 # signal-specific structured data
    recommended_action: str | None
    detected_at: datetime
```
The point of every Atlas screen: don't just show world data, show **which of the user's 
actual active vendors/shipments/budget lines it touches** — every screen must visibly 
connect a world event to something specific and named from the centralized demo data above, 
never a generic "here's some market data" view with no connection back to the user's real 
exposure.

One single .tsx file and one single .py file per feature. Framer-motion animations 
mandatory, matching established repo patterns — staggered mounts, count-up numbers, real 
hover states, no static unanimated screens.

Triggered specifically from a disruption context (e.g. reached via a "Find alternatives" 
action on the Political & Regulatory Risk or Customs screens when a real exposure is 
flagged) — this screen should visually acknowledge what triggered it at the top ("Because: 
South Korea tariff change affecting Shipment #4471").

**Grid layout:** a results grid of candidate alternate suppliers (2-3 per row), each card 
showing: supplier name, country/region, a "New to your network" badge (explicitly 
distinguishing this from Trustline's Backup Supplier Discovery, which only searches vendors 
you already trust — make that distinction visible in the UI copy itself, e.g. a small 
subtitle: "Sourced from global market data — not yet in your vendor network"), estimated 
lead time, and a "Start Prequalification" action button that would route toward Trustline's 
Supplier Workspace onboarding flow.

`GET /atlas/alternate-sourcing?product_category=&excluded_region=`. Seed a 
`GLOBAL_SUPPLIER_DIRECTORY` list (distinct from Trustline's vendor table — these are 
explicitly NOT yet-trusted vendors) with 4-5 entries across different regions/categories, 
filterable by product category and excluding the disrupted region. No LLM needed for the 
filtering itself. Return each candidate with a `network_status: "not_yet_onboarded"` field 
so the frontend badge is driven by real data, not hardcoded copy.
