# 2. Customs & Duty Monitoring — 2 files

## FILE 1 — component.tsx
CONTEXT: IDE agent with full repo access — Sentinel, Trustline, Compass, Arbiter, and 
Precedent are already built. DO NOT redefine the design system — reuse the existing color 
tokens, shadow tokens, animation primitives (`lib/animations.ts`), and card/grid patterns 
already established in the repo, especially Trustline's bento-grid + soft-depth treatment, 
which Atlas should visually match (Atlas is data-rich like Trustline, not flow-based like 
Sentinel).

CENTRALIZED DEMO DATA — reuse existing entities (Meridian Steel Fabrication / 
vendor_meridian_steel, Austin Semiconductor Fab / project_austin_fab) and add these Atlas-
specific ones, consistent across all ten files below:
- Active shipment: "Switchgear Shipment #4471" — Meridian Steel is the vendor, shipping 
  from a fabrication facility in Ulsan, South Korea, currently mid-transit toward the Port 
  of Houston, destined for project_austin_fab.
- Budget lines for project_austin_fab: structural steel ($2.1M budgeted), copper wiring 
  ($480K budgeted).

SHARED SHAPE — every Atlas signal extends this:
```python
class WorldSignal(BaseModel):
    signal_type: str            # e.g. "commodity_price", "port_congestion", "tariff_change"
    affected_entity_ids: list[str]   # which of YOUR vendors/shipments/projects this touches
    severity: Literal["info","watch","action_needed"]
    summary: str
    detail: dict                 # signal-specific structured data
    recommended_action: str | None
    detected_at: datetime
```
The point of every Atlas screen: don't just show world data, show **which of the user's 
actual active vendors/shipments/budget lines it touches** — every screen must visibly 
connect a world event to something specific and named from the centralized demo data above, 
never a generic "here's some market data" view with no connection back to the user's real 
exposure.

One single .tsx file and one single .py file per feature. Framer-motion animations 
mandatory, matching established repo patterns — staggered mounts, count-up numbers, real 
hover states, no static unanimated screens.

**Grid layout (3 cards):**
- **Hero card (col-span-2):** shows Switchgear Shipment #4471 specifically — origin (Ulsan, 
  South Korea) to destination (Houston) route on a simple stylized line/dot map (doesn't 
  need a real map library, a simplified SVG path with origin/destination markers is fine), 
  with any relevant duty/tariff rule affecting this specific route+product category called 
  out directly on the card, not as a separate generic list.
- **Duty Impact card:** a before/after landed-cost comparison — "Original estimate: 
  $184,000 — After recent tariff change: $201,000" with the delta highlighted --warning.
- **Alert History card:** a small timeline of past duty/customs alerts that have fired for 
  this project, so this reads as ongoing monitoring, not a one-time check.

`GET /atlas/customs-duty-status?shipment_id=shipment_4471`. Deterministic rule lookup — no 
LLM. Seed a `DUTY_RULES` table keyed by (origin_country, product_category) with a 
plausible tariff rate, and seed a recent rate change scenario for the South Korea → 
switchgear route specifically. Compute landed cost before/after using the shipment's 
declared value from seeded data. `needs_human=True` whenever a duty change affects an 
active, already-in-transit shipment (as opposed to a future order, which has more time to 
adjust).
